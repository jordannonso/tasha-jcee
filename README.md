two birds meet one seem not interested the other is fierce and a bully , they sing the same song and end up flying heights beyond mountains never to be separted
the biggest failure is not knowing to best and you die doesnt matter the succes you attain, i always had the knack for friction creation ,stories , and maybe altered history. love to explore new ideas ,new england patrtiot fan(yes we still the best we dont care how), aniamtiom movies are my thing, and hanging out with people i care about.
